    <h1>Crafting</h1>
      <h3>Crochet projects</h3>
        <p>
          I have a passion for crochet and have made and given away many projects over the years.

    <h1>Games</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing games of all varieties - video, board and card.  My family frequently has game nights and can be found playing <strong>Exploding Kittens</strong>, <strong>Sushi Go</strong>, <strong>Mario Party</strong>, or one of the many other games we own.</p>
      <p>We are learning how to play <strong>Magic</strong> as a family - which is quite an adventure!</p>
      <p>I also play <strong>Path of Exile</strong> whenever I can.</p>
      <p>
        My husband and I have taken part in a local bean bag league since it began.  We even made our own boards (he did most of the work!)

    <h1>Movies, Books and Music</h1>
      <p>
        I am an avid reader and a dedicated moviegoer.  My family owns hundreds of movies and books.  We love to go see new movies and discuss our favorite parts (and sometimes least favorite) as a family on the drive home.</p>
      <p>
        I enjoy music of many different genres and love live music.  My husband and I frequently go to see bands we love.  I have also been to see bands I have never heard of that my children love and enjoyed those experiences as well.</p>
